# 🌍 Climate Change and Agriculture Analysis

This project analyzes how **climate change impacts agriculture** across different countries and regions. Using statistical analysis and visualizations, it explores the relationships between climate variables (temperature, precipitation, CO2 emissions, extreme weather events) and agricultural outcomes (crop yield, soil health, economic impact).

## 📌 Features & Analysis
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
  - Loaded agricultural and climate dataset.
  - Handled categorical and numerical features.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Average Temperature by Region (bar chart).
  - Crop Yield Over Years (line chart).
  - Crop Type distribution (pie chart).
  - Distribution of CO2 Emissions (histogram).
  - Crop Yield by Country (box plot).
  - Correlation Matrix of numeric variables (heatmap).
  - CO2 Emissions vs. Crop Yield (scatter plot).
  - Pairwise relationships among features (pairplot).
  - Economic Impact by Region (box plot).
  - Irrigation Access by Crop Type (violin plot).
  - Extreme Weather Events by Region (count plot).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – visualizations

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Rising **CO2 emissions** and **extreme weather events** have a negative impact on crop yield.  
- **Irrigation access** varies significantly by crop type and region.  
- Regions with **higher average temperatures** face reduced soil health and crop yields.  
- Climate change leads to measurable **economic losses** in agriculture.
